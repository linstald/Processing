# Processing
This Repo contains (most of) my [Processing](https://processing.org/) projects.

Here is a little description of all the different projects:

## DieDistributions
Demonstrates the distribution of the value of the sum of k die rolls, when repeated n times. k correlates to the vertical position of the mouse, while n is correlating to the horizontal position of the mouse.


## Forces
This is a little work-in-progress phsyicsengine. So far you can add Balls (Mousedrag) or new lines (press 's' and then draw a line with the mouse). Press 'c' to clear the lines, 'space' to clear all Balls, and apply forces to the Ball by pressing the arrowkeys.

## Fraktale
This project contains some programs, which create famous Fractals:
- [Mandelbrotset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set)
- [Julia-Sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set)
- [Pythagoras-tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras_tree_(fractal))

## Generation
This is a simple implementation of a genetic algorithm. The 'blobbs' are trying to get to the target, where they have to go around the obstacles. Starting with a random method of walking they evolve over time.

## L_Systems
A Processing sketch (with some purely java code) drawing the sirpinksi triangle using L-Systems. You can change the rules in VarsLSystem.java and the angle in L_Systems.pde to create an other fractal.

## LaufzeitAnalyse
A little program, demonstrating runtime. Just for demo purposes.

## LucasAmplitudenzaehler
A androidapp which increases a counter when there is a high volume sound.

## Minesweeper
Classic Minesweeper, without settings.

## PhysikDemo
A Physics Simulation (colliding Masses)

## Plotter
A program which can plot several things:
- Fractals
- Functions
- Chaostheory-simulations
- etc.  
  Zoom with mousewheel, '+' and '-' to switch the plots.

## QuickSort
A visualization of the QuickSort-algorithm.

## Relativity
its a little simulation of the special Relativty (relativity of simultaneity)

## RiemannIntegral
A visualization of the [Riemann Integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_integral)

## SierpinskiDreieck
Simulation of the [Sierpinski-Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle)

## Snake
classic snake game, with open borders.

## TicTacToe
classic TicTacToe, without any AI.

## Vulkan
A little game, where you have to click on the rocks spit out from the vulcano.

## Worldmap
This processing sketch visualizes the average (fixed) broadband bandwidth of each country. The greener a country is filled the higher average bandwidth it has. (As of March 2021)

## Wurmspiel
play around with worm mechanics
